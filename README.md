# Automatic-number-plate-detection
## Project Description
In this project i have used pytesseract, open cv, os, imultis packages. 
I used a car video to collect the images from the video and extracted it in a folder.  
After this i checked whether the images in the extracted folder are duplicate or not. 
If duplicate images are there then it will remove it.
Then change image to text to get the text of the car number plate.
Compare the number if it is correct the open the garage message will print.
